# Discord ↔ Intent Bridge

Bidirectional sync bot for gradual migration.

## How It Works

Bot sits in both Discord and Intent servers:
- Forwards messages in both directions
- Syncs edits and deletes
- Proxies attachments
- Masquerades user avatars/names

## Use Case

Server owner announces:
"We're moving to Intent. Here's the link. Messages sync for 30 days. Discord goes read-only on March 1."

Everyone can use either platform during transition.
